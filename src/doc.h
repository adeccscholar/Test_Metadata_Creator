\page spgDesignBlotter first impressions of the application
\section spgDesignBlotter_Brainstorming from the idea of a training program to the first draft
\details You can find the first impressions of the project "simple person management" at this page. 
         The first meetings are often informal and usually start with brainstorming sessions.
\details Any project starts with an idea and a vision, and the basic conditions must also be defined. 
         What problem is to be solved? Which development system should be used, which platforms should 
		 serve as a target? 
\details This is usually not done on the computer, and is often done on media such as a pad of squared 
         paper or napkins. Nevertheless, these can also be added to later for documentation and made 
		 available digitally.

\details The initial considerations should quickly become sketched models and possible steps can be 
         planned. In the beginning, the focus is more on correlations, but these are already oriented 
		 towards a possible data model.

\details Ideas for the possibilities and extensions should be discussed at the beginning, even if they 
         are not implemented in the first step. However, they help to define a more correct model and 
		 enable further development at a later stage. This discussion should also be held with the 
		 customer as soon as possible.

\section spgDesignBlotter_Whiteboard next steps
\details As the process progresses, the meetings and tools often become more formal. The focus is on 
         working together on the problem and providing all the information to the team. 
\details Here is a picture of the first thoughts on the data model from the digital whiteboard.
